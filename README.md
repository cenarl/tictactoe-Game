# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game written in JavaScript. The game allows for two-player mode or playing against the computer. In the computer mode, there are two difficulty levels: easy and hard. 

## Game Features

- Two-player mode: Play against another person on the same device.
- Computer mode: Play against the computer with two difficulty levels.
- Easy Mode: The computer makes random moves on the board.
- Hard Mode: The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to make smart moves.

## Minimax Algorithm

The `getBestMove` method in the code utilizes the Minimax algorithm to determine the optimal move for the computer player in the hard difficulty mode. The Minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm that evaluates all possible moves and their outcomes to find the best move for the current player. It assigns a score to each move and chooses the move with the highest score. This allows the computer player to make intelligent and strategic moves.

## Getting Started

To play the Tic Tac Toe game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The game board will be displayed, and you can start playing immediately.

## Game Controls

- Click on an empty cell to place your X or O.
- In the two-player mode, players take turns placing their respective symbols.
- In the computer mode, the computer will automatically make its move after the player's turn.
